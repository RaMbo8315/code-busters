This is a workflow app that tracks the service tickets for a business. This will allow businesses to manage clientâ€™s requests while also tracking what is being worked on daily. 

Through this app, the user with Admin access is able to create review, and assign workflows to Techs. Clients can create an account and create a ticket.  
 
 Future Development:
